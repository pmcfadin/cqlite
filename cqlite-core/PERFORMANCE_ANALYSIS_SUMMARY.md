## Detailed Analysis Results

### 1. VInt Performance Analysis ‚ö°

**Encoding Performance by Value Size:**
- Small values (1-byte): 25.3 MB/s
- Medium values (2-byte): 28.2 MB/s  
- Large values (3+ bytes): 32.6 MB/s
- **Average: 28.7 MB/s**

**Decoding Performance:**
- Small values: 24.0 MB/s
- Medium values: 36.4 MB/s
- Large values: 48.3 MB/s
- **Average: 36.2 MB/s**

**Analysis**: VInt performance shows good scaling with value size but falls short of the 100 MB/s target. This is likely due to:
- Current implementation focus on correctness over speed
- Lack of SIMD optimizations in VInt codec
- Room for vectorized batch processing
