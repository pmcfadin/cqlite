# CQLite: Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary

CQLite is an Apache-licensed, high-performance Rust library that provides SQLite-like local access to Apache Cassandra SSTables. Designed by Apache Cassandra PMC member Patrick McFadin, this community-driven project enables developers to read and write Cassandra 5+ data files locally without networking or cluster dependencies, with bindings for Python, NodeJS, and WASM deployment. The project embodies Apache Cassandra community values and will be donated to the Apache Cassandra project.

## 1. Product Vision

**Mission**: Lower the friction to Cassandra data by providing a fast, safe, and lightweight library for local SSTable operations, built with Apache community principles and Patrick McFadin's 13 years of Cassandra expertise.
