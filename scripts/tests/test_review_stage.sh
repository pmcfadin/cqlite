# Regression tests for scripts/flow/review-stage.sh (issue #3751).
#
# FAST + HERMETIC: no network, no datasets, no cargo, no gh, and NOTHING is read from the
# surrounding checkout. Every case builds a SYNTHETIC git repository under `mktemp -d` (a
# `git init` plus a `.gitignore` — never a commit, so no git identity is needed) and runs the
# SHIPPED script with that repository as cwd. The script's only environmental inputs are
# `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and `git check-ignore`, both of which then answer about the
# scratch repo. A suite header claiming "hermetic" while its green cases measure the
# surrounding repository is the defect class #3650 review R5 F2 records one file over, so the
# claim is made true by construction here rather than asserted.
#
# WHY A POSITIVE CONTROL IS THE FIRST REQUIREMENT OF THIS FILE
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# The subject is a mechanism whose safe answer is `NOT-RUN`. An implementation that answered
# `NOT-RUN` for EVERY input would satisfy every negative case in this suite and be useless —
# a guard that cannot green vacuously is the standing requirement (#1699/#3544). So case 2
# writes a REAL report and requires `PASS` with exit 0, and the FINDINGS case requires exit
# 4: the three non-NOT-RUN tokens are each proved REACHABLE before any refusal is asserted.
#
# WHY EVERY NOT-RUN CAUSE IS ASSERTED BY NAME
# -------------------------------------------
# Five states share one token and one exit code, and the operator action differs per state
# ("the agent produced nothing" / "someone deleted the file" / "you never opened a stage" are
# three different next moves). Asserting exit 5 alone would pass on a script that collapsed
# all five into one message — which is the collapse this issue exists to remove. So each
# cause is matched as TEXT.

# this repo a floor carries a margin because a legitimately-configured host can DISPLACE

# correct machine. This suite has NO such branch: its only requirements are bash and git,
# every case runs on every host, no assertion is host-conditional, and a missing git is a hard
# failure because the subject IS a git-worktree tool. So the largest legitimate displacement
# is 0, and `measured - 0` is the strongest detector available — a floor with slack is a floor
# that stops noticing a silently-dying section. Adding cases never reds it (it is a lower
