# Regression check for issue #2964: scripts/flow/roborev-review.sh must FAIL
# CLOSED on every recorded vacuous-review trigger, and must never let one be
# reported as "roborev clean".
#
# The wrapper's verdict gates a merge (flow-implement's review-first pass and
# flow-closer's confirmation pass before arming `gh pr merge --auto`), so a
# weakened assert in it means the pipeline merges unreviewed code with no red
# anywhere. This check pins all seven triggers so a regression FAILs the fast
# `--lite` loop instead of costing a review round.
#
# HERMETIC BY CONSTRUCTION: no network, no real roborev, no dataset corpus, no
# cargo. A STUB `roborev` placed FIRST on PATH replays the recorded real outputs
# (enqueue lines, verdict text, `show --json` token payloads) against throwaway
# `git init` fixtures that carry their own local bare "origin" so the push assert
# can be exercised in both directions. Everything lives under one temp dir removed
# on EXIT. No wall-clock threshold assert anywhere in the correctness path (#2642).
#
# Run standalone:   bash scripts/tests/test_roborev_review_guard.sh
# Or via the gate:  scripts/agent-gate.sh --lite   (roborev-lints component)
#                   scripts/agent-gate.sh          (roborev-lints + tooling-tests)

# The stub reviewer: first on PATH, driven entirely by STUB_* env vars, replaying
# the RECORDED SHAPE of the real binary's payload — notably `token_usage`, which is
# a JSON-ENCODED STRING (decoded twice) carrying `total_output_tokens`, not a nested
# object with `output_tokens`. Getting that shape wrong is exactly how tier 2 was
# permanently UNAVAILABLE, so the stub reproduces it verbatim.
#   STUB_ANNOUNCE_SHA    sha to announce; empty => emit NO enqueue announcement
#   STUB_JOB             job id in the announcement / json payloads
#   STUB_VERDICT         verdict text written to the transcript

#   STUB_MODEL           job model field
#   STUB_REQUESTED_MODEL job requested_model field
#   STUB_PROMPT          prompt text (plain, no quotes/backslashes)
#   STUB_VERDICT_FIELD   the job record's structured `verdict` letter (P/F), '' to omit
#   STUB_PAYLOAD_JOB     the id INSIDE the payload (differs from the announced job to
#                        pin the narrowed ID-less fallback in roborev-job-facts.py)
#   STUB_RECORD_BLANK_FOR the first N record reads return an empty record, so the
#                        wrapper's bounded read RETRY can be exercised (a transient
#                        read failure — there is no asynchronous write to wait out;
#                        counter kept in $STUB_INVOKED.reads)
#   STUB_HAS_TOKEN_DATA  emit a has_token_data field with this value (true/false)
#   STUB_LIST_JSON       `none` => `list --json` returns null, so `show` is the only
#                        record source
#   STUB_SHOW_JSON       `none` => `show --json` returns null; `nested` => the MEASURED
#                        shape (review row nesting the job row under "job"); `review-row` => it
#                        returns the REAL review-row shape (id/prompt, no git_ref or
#                        status), forcing the richer `list --json` source; otherwise the
#                        `list --json` fallback path
#   STUB_CONFIG_PATTERNS what `roborev config get exclude_patterns` prints; EMPTY =>
#                        the subcommand is unsupported (exit 64), i.e. the corroboration
#                        state the check must report UNAVAILABLE rather than fail on
