#!/usr/bin/env bash
# gate-detached.sh — run scripts/agent-gate.sh in its OWN cgroup, so a lane session's
# teardown cannot kill it (issue #3473 AC3).
#
# THE PROBLEM, MEASURED
# ---------------------
# Every process a lane session spawns — including one launched with `nohup`, `setsid`,
# closed fds and a ppid of 1 — inherits the lane pane's systemd scope
# (`tmux-spawn-<uuid>.scope`). That scope carries the systemd defaults
# `KillMode=control-group`, `SendSIGKILL=yes`, `TimeoutStopUSec=90s`. When it is torn
# down, systemd signals EVERY task in the cgroup.
#
# Cgroup membership is inherited across fork and CANNOT be shed by detaching from the
# controlling terminal, the process group or the session. That is why `nohup`/`setsid`
# do not help, and why the symptom was indiscriminate: #3473 recorded a passive `sleep`
# loop dying alongside the gate, which correctly ruled out CPU, memory, disk and the
# #1825 slot cap — a cgroup kill does not care what the work is.
#
# It also explains the control the issue reported: the coordination lead's gate,
# launched over `ssh` + `nohup`, completed on the same box, same sha, same slot cap. An
# ssh login gets its own `session-N.scope`, a DIFFERENT cgroup, so a lane pane's
# teardown never reaches it. The variable was never the work — it was the cgroup.
#
# THE FIX
# -------
# `systemd-run --user` starts the gate as a transient unit under `app.slice`, i.e. in a
# cgroup of its own, parented by the systemd user manager rather than by this session.
# The lane can then exit, crash, be recycled or have its pane killed, and the gate runs
# to its verdict. Measured on this fleet: two identical tickers, one inheriting a
# `KillMode=control-group` cgroup (with setsid+nohup+closed fds) and one in its own
# scope; on teardown the first died leaving NO trace, the second was untouched.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO
# ---------------------
# It does not make the gate faster, and it does not remove the #1825 slot cap — a
# detached gate still queues. It also does not let you walk away without a plan for
# reading the verdict: use scripts/gate-liveness.sh, which distinguishes RUNNING from
# REAPED (this script prints the exact command).
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/flow/gate-detached.sh [--summary <path>] [--log <path>] [--] [gate args...]
#
# Prints the unit name, summary path, heartbeat path and the poll command, then exits
# 0 immediately — the gate keeps running. Any remaining arguments go to agent-gate.sh.

# Environment forwarding. THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL PLUMBING.
#
# A transient unit does NOT inherit the caller's environment — it starts from the
# systemd user manager's. Silently dropping the caller's environment would hand the
# gate a different PATH (no cargo/rustup), no CQLITE_DATASETS_ROOT and no sccache
# wiring, and the gate would then fail or SKIP for reasons that have nothing to do with
# the branch under test. Worse, it could look like a real red.
#
# So we forward EVERY exported variable, minus a deny-list, rather than an allowlist of
# the ones someone remembered. An allowlist here fails silently and asymmetrically: a
# new gate-relevant variable is simply absent, and nothing says so. The deny-list holds
# only variables that MUST be re-derived by the new unit (systemd's own invocation
# identity) or that name this session's own bookkeeping.
#
# Two shapes are refused rather than mangled, and both are REPORTED, not swallowed: a
# name that is not a portable shell identifier, and a value containing a newline
# (systemd-run's --setenv is a single line). A dropped variable is printed by name so a
# gate that then behaves oddly has a paper trail.
