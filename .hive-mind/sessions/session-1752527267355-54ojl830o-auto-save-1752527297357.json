            "objective": "I want to build a Rust library/system like SQLite but for Apache Cassandra. It would only read and write sstable in a local directory like SQLite. No netowkring and no clusters. The access would be through a library call from something like python or NodeJS. Rust for speed and memeory safety and potentially running in something like WASM. There have been attempts to do this in Python and it has been done in C++. The trick is reading and writing SSTABles in the format expected by Cassandra. Doing a deep dive into the format and how java does it in the prject is ultra important. Think through a research strategy and build and architecture. Previous efforts have been stuck on trying to read and write SSTables in Cassandra 5 format with a known schmea. You have access to the CQL grammar files in the Cassandra Github project as well as all the storage code. For this pass, create a PRD with an R&D plan to create the parsing libraries.",
